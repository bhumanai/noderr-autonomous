## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### UI loads but no data
- The backend at uncle-frank-claude.fly.dev needs the Git module deployed
- Use local mock mode for testing

### Can't drag tasks on mobile
- Ensure you're using a modern mobile browser
- Try Chrome or Safari
- Clear browser cache

### GitHub Pages not working
- Make sure you're on main branch
- Check Settings > Pages is configured
- Wait 5-10 minutes for initial deployment
- URL format: https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]/
