# 🧠 AI-Powered Brainstorming Setup Guide

## What's New

Your Noderr system now has **REAL AI intelligence** using OpenAI GPT-5 instead of hardcoded responses!

### Key Improvements:
- **Intelligent Task Generation**: GPT-5 analyzes your request and generates specific, actionable tasks
- **Proper Task Sizing**: Each task is 2-4 hours (no more "Make UI" vagueness)
- **Approval Workflow**: Review and approve tasks before they go to Kanban
- **Smart Dependencies**: Tasks ordered by dependencies, no circular refs
- **Rich Details**: Each task has title, description, technical notes, and time estimates

## 🔑 Setup OpenAI API Key

### 1. Get Your API Key
1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Sign in or create account
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create new secret key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)

### 2. Add to Vercel
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard:
Settings → Environment Variables → Add New

Name: OPENAI_API_KEY
Value: sk-your-api-key-here
Environment: Production
```

### 3. Add to Railway
```bash
# In Railway dashboard:
Variables → New Variable

OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-your-api-key-here
```

### 4. Add to Local Development
```bash
# Create .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here" > .env

# Or export directly
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"
```

## 🎯 How to Use the New Brainstorming

### 1. Start a Brainstorm Session
- Click "🧠 Brainstorm" tab
- Type your requirement naturally

### 2. Good Examples:
```
✅ "Add SSO login with Google OAuth"
✅ "Implement real-time notifications using WebSockets"
✅ "Create admin dashboard for user management"
✅ "Add Stripe payment integration with subscriptions"
```

### 3. AI Generates Smart Tasks:
```
□ Set up Google Cloud Console OAuth credentials (2h)
   - Register application
   - Configure redirect URIs
   - Get client ID and secret

□ Install Passport.js with Google OAuth strategy (2h)
   - Add passport and passport-google-oauth20
   - Configure middleware
   - Set up session serialization

□ Create OAuth callback endpoints (3h)
   - POST /api/auth/google
   - GET /api/auth/google/callback
   - Handle JWT generation

□ Build SSO login UI components (2h)
   - Google sign-in button
   - Loading states
   - Error handling

□ Implement user session management (3h)
   - Store OAuth users in database
   - Handle first-time vs returning
   - Implement secure logout
```

### 4. Approval Workflow:
- ✅ **Check** tasks you want to keep
- ❌ **Uncheck** tasks you don't need
- Use **"✅ All"** to approve everything
- Use **"❌ None"** to reject all
- Only approved tasks export to Kanban

### 5. Dependencies:
- Tasks show "⚡ Depends on: Task 1, 2"
- Exported in correct order
- No task depends on unfinished work

## 💰 Cost Estimation

### OpenAI API Pricing (GPT-5):
- **Input**: $0.03 per 1K tokens (~750 words)
- **Output**: $0.06 per 1K tokens

### Typical Usage:
- **Per brainstorm**: ~2,000 tokens = $0.12
- **Monthly (50 sessions)**: ~$6
- **Heavy use (200 sessions)**: ~$24

### Tips to Reduce Costs:
1. Use GPT-3.5-turbo for simpler tasks (10x cheaper)
2. Cache similar requests
3. Set spending limits in OpenAI dashboard

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Change AI Model (in `api/brainstorm-ai.js`):
```javascript
// For best quality (latest):
model = 'gpt-5-2025-08-07'  // Latest GPT-5 model (Default)

// For previous versions:
model = 'gpt-4-turbo-preview'  // GPT-4 Turbo
model = 'gpt-4'  // GPT-4
model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'  // GPT-3.5 (cheapest)
```

### Adjust Task Size:
```javascript
// In system prompt:
"Each task should take 2-4 hours"  // Default
"Each task should take 4-8 hours"  // Larger tasks
"Each task should take 1-2 hours"  // Micro tasks
```

### Customize Response:
```javascript
// Adjust temperature (0-1):
temperature: 0.7  // Default - balanced
temperature: 0.3  // More focused, deterministic
temperature: 0.9  // More creative, varied
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "AI analysis failed" error:
1. Check API key is set correctly
2. Verify OpenAI account has credits
3. Check browser console for details

### Tasks too vague:
- Be specific in your request
- Include tech stack details
- Mention constraints/requirements

### Tasks too granular:
- Ask for "high-level tasks"
- Mention "2-4 hour chunks"
- Use refine button to consolidate

### No tasks generated:
- API key might be invalid
- OpenAI service might be down
- Falls back to basic tasks

---

## 📊 Fallback Behavior

When AI is unavailable, the system provides:
- Basic task templates
- Common patterns (auth, CRUD, etc.)
- Reasonable time estimates
- Still has approval workflow

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Writing Good Prompts:
```
GOOD: "Add Stripe subscription payments with webhook handling"
- Specific technology (Stripe)
- Clear feature (subscriptions)
- Technical detail (webhooks)

BAD: "Add payments"
- Too vague
- Missing details
- No technical context
```

### Include Context:
```
"Add user authentication using our existing PostgreSQL database and Express backend"
```

### Specify Constraints:
```
"Implement search feature that works with our current Elasticsearch setup, must handle 10k requests/min"
```
