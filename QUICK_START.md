## 🎮 How to Use

### Brainstorming Flow:
1. **Describe your idea** in natural language
2. **AI asks clarifying questions** to understand requirements
3. **System researches** codebase patterns and best practices  
4. **Adversarial agents** identify risks and mitigations
5. **Engine generates** detailed micro-tasks with dependencies
6. **Export to Kanban** for execution

### Task Management:
- **Backlog**: All generated tasks
- **Ready**: Tasks ready to work on
- **Working**: Currently in progress
- **Review**: Completed, needs approval
- **Pushed**: Approved and deployed
